      <p class="style5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professional Caretakers for over 10  years, Scott and Coral Barry (and family) relocated to Harstine Island  in October of 2008.  Their first  caretaker position was at a prestigious Horse Ranch called Equi Satori.  Nestled in the heart of the wine country in  Northern California, Equi Satori is home to both Arabian and Andalusia  horses.  Living in the caretaker cottage,  the Barry’s were responsible for providing all the maintenance and security for  the 10 acre ranch.  Learning the ropes regarding  horses was second nature to them, and they both soon branched out to other  ranches (Skyhorse and Strozzi Ranch) to lend support and gain more experience  in their spare time.  <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After their mission was complete at  Equi Satori, they were offered a caretakership in a 100 year old cabin just  over the bridge on Harstine   Island. The cabin needed many repairs and lots of TLC.  Their time in the cabin was spent remodeling  various rooms and getting acquainted with the Island.  <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, the Barrys were offered  another caretakership on the south end of Harstine Island  on a three house, 11 acre estate.  They  are currently living and doing repairs on the property and providing security  to protect the owner’s investment.</p>

      <strong>Island Caretaking Services</strong> provides secure, professional property monitoring day and night.<br />
      <br />
      We specialize in four areas:<br />
      <br />
      1. Home  patrols, to your location during the day or night. (daily, weekly or  monthly) We will alert authorities if there are any suspicious  activities in and around your property.<br />
      <br />
      2. Gate checks and installations of gates to insure no one will compromise the security of your gate on the property.<br />
      <br />
      3. Placements  of our own certified caretakers in your unoccupied cabin or vacation  home if you feel the need to have a presence there. Caretakers will  also offer home improvements if the property owner needs anything on  the property.<br />
      <br />
      4. Installations of other security features such as motion detector lights or security systems.<br />
      <br />
      Home  and land security should be your number one priority no matter where  you live. The odds are stacked against you if you own a vacation home  that you don't live in. Homes that are occupied are less likely to be  targeted by burglers.  Burglary and theft are on the increase due to  our sagging economy. With<strong> Island Caretaking Services </strong>you  can balance the odds in your favor. <br />
      <br />
      Please call us today for a no  obligation appointment to let our specialist do an in-home evaluation.  Licensed and bonded. <span class="style2"><br />
